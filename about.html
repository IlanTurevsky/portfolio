                        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm Ilan, a 15-year-old sophomore at Belmont Hill School in Massachusetts. I like
                            building things—mostly robots and software, sometimes both at once.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Longer Version</h2>
                        <p>
                            I've been interested in tech for as long as I can remember. It started with just
                            wanting to know how things worked—taking stuff apart, trying to put it back
                            together (with varying success). Eventually that turned into writing code and
                            building actual projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My first real project was an autonomous follow-bot I made in 8th grade. It was
                            pretty basic—just a little car with sensors that would try to follow you around.
                            But finishing that project made me realize I actually enjoyed this stuff, not
                            just as a class assignment but as something I wanted to do on my own time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since then I've gotten more into robotics and AI. Right now I'm working on a
                            prosthetic hand that uses flex sensors to mimic finger movements. It's challenging
                            and I break things constantly, but that's kind of the fun part—figuring out why
                            something doesn't work and how to fix it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of tech, I sail competitively (been on varsity for three years), wrestle,
                            and help run our school's drone club. I also fish a lot in the summer—it's a good
                            way to not think about code for a while.

                            I'm currently working with Dr. Chris Connor, a professor at Harvard Medical School,
                            to rewrite his BIS monitor algorithm (called ibis) from MATLAB to Python. The goal
                            is to create an open Python library called pyibis. It's a signal processing project
                            involving EEG data—definitely challenging, but I'm learning a ton about engineering
                            and biomedical signal processing along the way.
