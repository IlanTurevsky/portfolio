                        <p>
                            I did a game development internship last summer, and by the end of it I'd
                            actually made a game that people could play. It's nothing like the big games
                            you'd buy on Steam, but it was cool to go through the whole process from
                            start to finish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The hardest part was probably project management—figuring out what features
                            to cut because I was running out of time, deciding what was "good enough"
                            to ship. Before this I'd started a bunch of game projects but never actually
                            finished any of them, so learning to scope things down was really valuable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used Unity with C#, which was new to me at the time. The game itself is
                            pretty simple—I don't want to oversell it—but the fact that it's playable
                            and published online is something I'm proud of.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What I learned</h3>

                            <li>Working with Unity and C# basics</li>
                            <li>Game design principles and playtesting</li>
